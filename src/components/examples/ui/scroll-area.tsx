      Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and
      leaving jokes all over the place: under the king&apos;s pillow, in his
      soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn&apos;t
      seem to stop Jokester. And then, one day, the people of the kingdom
      discovered that the jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they
      couldn&apos;t help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they
      couldn&apos;t stop.
